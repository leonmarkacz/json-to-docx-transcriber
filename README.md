## Description

This repository contains a Python script designed to parse JSON files generated by AWS Transcribe and convert the transcriptions into DOCX documents. The script reads the JSON, processes the transcription data, and outputs a formatted DOCX file with speaker labels and timestamps.

## Features

- Parses AWS Transcribe JSON files.
- Outputs transcription content to a DOCX file.
- Includes speaker labels and timestamps in the output.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `python-docx` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/leonmarkacz/json-to-docx-transcriber.git
   ```
2. Change into the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd json-to-docx-transcriber
   ```
3. Install the required Python package:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command:

```sh
python transcribe.py -f <path_to_json_file>
```

For example:

```sh
python transcribe.py -f sample_transcription.json
```

This will generate a DOCX file named `sample_transcription_result.docx` in the same directory as the input JSON file.

## Script Overview

The main script `transcribe.py` performs the following steps:

1. Reads the input JSON file.
2. Processes the speaker labels and items to align timestamps with speakers.
3. Constructs lines of text with corresponding speakers and timestamps.
4. Outputs the formatted lines to a DOCX file.
